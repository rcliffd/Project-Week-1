# Project-Week-1

Dream Team Project

Music Database App

In our app, you can listen to music, and get information on how to buy the artistsâ€™ albums. We also want to have a list of songs that the user can play, a link to purchase songs, as well as a biography of the artist and pictures. The site also shows the top 5 YouTube videos of the artist.



Rene and Ben will work on the front end.

Ashleigh and Connor on the back end.

Rich will do API research and AJAX. GitHub Manager.
